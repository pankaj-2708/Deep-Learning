    "## Keras Functional API: Building Non-Linear Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction and Context\n",
    "\n",
    "The Keras Functional API is a powerful tool for continuing deep learning studies, enabling the creation of complex neural network topologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Previous Approach:** All models built previously (e.g., ANNs or CNNs) utilized the **Sequential API**.\n",
    "*   **Sequential API Limitation:** Sequential models follow a **linear topology**, meaning layers are arranged one after the other. They typically handle a single input and produce a single output.\n",
    "*   **Functional API Purpose:** To create **non-linear neural networks**. This includes handling **Multi-Input**, **Multi-Output**, and utilizing **shared layers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you master the Functional API, your \"imagination is the limit\" for creating any neural network topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Why Non-Linear Topologies are Necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex problems often require branching or merging paths that linear topologies cannot handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Problem Example | Input(s) | Output(s) | Topology Requirements |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Face Analysis** | Image of a human face | Age (Regression) & Emotion (Classification) | Input features pass through a shared CNN base, then **branch** into two separate fully connected pathways. |\n",
    "| **E-commerce Price Prediction** | Product Metadata (tabular), Product Description (text), Product Image (image) | Price Prediction | Requires three separate neural networks (e.g., RNN for text, CNN for image). Features extracted from all three must be **concatenated** (joined) before final prediction. |\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the **Sequential API fails** because it cannot handle these non-linear architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Basic Functional Model Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how to predict two things (Age and Place) from a single tabular input (Yearly Salary, Height, Marital Status).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Architecture (Multi-Output)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Input Layer (3 columns).\n",
    "2.  Dense Layer (e.g., 64 neurons, ReLU).\n",
    "3.  **Branching Point**.\n",
    "    *   Branch 1: Output 1 (Age prediction; e.g., 1 neuron, Linear activation for regression).\n",
    "    *   Branch 2: Output 2 (Place/City prediction; e.g., 2 neurons, implied Softmax/Sigmoid for classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Import Necessary Classes:**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    from keras.models import Model\n",
    "    from keras.layers import Input, Dense  # And other required layers\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Define the Input Layer(s):** Use the `Input` class and specify the expected shape. You must give every layer a name.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    input_layer = Input(shape=3, name='Input')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Define and Connect Hidden Layers:** When defining a layer, pass the previous layer's output to it.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    hidden_one = Dense(64, activation='relu', name='Hidden_One')(input_layer)\n",
    "    # The output of the layer is the connection point (X)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Define Output Branches (Branching):**\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    output_age = Dense(1, activation='linear', name='Age_Output')(hidden_one)  # Connected to hidden_one\n",
    "    output_place = Dense(2, activation='softmax', name='Place_Output')(hidden_one) # Connected to hidden_one\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Instantiate the Model:** Define the `inputs` and `outputs`. Multiple inputs or outputs must be passed as a list.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    model = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=[output_age, output_place])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Complex Architecture: Multi-Input and Concatenation\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is required when different data types (e.g., tabular and image data) must be processed by separate networks and then combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Architecture Components:** Two separate branches (e.g., Branch A processing Input A, and Branch B processing Input B).\n",
    "*   **Feature Extraction:** Each branch extracts features using its own set of layers.\n",
    "*   **Concatenation:** The final feature outputs from both branches (e.g., `X1` and `Y2`) are combined using a `Concatenate` layer.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    combined = concatenate([X1, Y2])\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "*   **Final Layers:** The combined feature layer (`combined`) is then passed through subsequent Dense layers to reach the single final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Case Study: Transfer Learning with Multi-Output (Age and Gender)\n",
    "\n",
    "This example utilizes image data (UTK Face dataset) to predict both Age (regression) and Gender (classification) using VGG16.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Strategy and Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy involves using **Transfer Learning**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Import the **VGG16 convolutional base** (`include_top=False`).\n",
    "2.  Pass the VGG16 output through a **Flatten Layer**.\n",
    "3.  Branch into two separate fully connected layers (one for Age, one for Gender).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B. Data Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a data generator (e.g., `flow_from_dataframe`) for a multi-output problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The `y` information (labels) must be passed as a **list** containing all output columns (e.g., `['age_column', 'gender_column']`).\n",
    "*   The generator's `class_mode` parameter must be set to **'multi_output'**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C. Model Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "When compiling the functional model, you must specify loss functions and metrics for *each* output.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Losses:** Pass the losses as a list or a dictionary. The losses must correspond to the type of prediction (e.g., specific loss for Age regression, another for Gender classification).\n",
    "*   **Loss Weights:** You can use a dictionary to assign different weights to the outputs during training (e.g., giving the Gender prediction higher importance/weight).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n",
    "              loss={'Age_Output': 'mse', 'Gender_Output': 'binary_crossentropy'},\n",
    "              loss_weights={'Age_Output': 0.1, 'Gender_Output': 1.0})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The training is completed using the standard `model.fit()` call.\n",
    "\n",
