    "## I. The Necessity of Positional Encoding (The Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "The sources establish that the **Self-Attention** module, which forms the core of the Transformer, possesses two major advantages over previous architectures like RNNs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Contextual Embeddings:** Self-Attention can generate dynamic, contextual embeddings that change based on how a word is used in a sentence (e.g., distinguishing \"river bank\" from \"money bank\").\n",
    "2.  **Parallel Computation:** All contextual embeddings can be calculated **simultaneously (in parallel)**, which is crucial for speed and processing large documents (e.g., a 10,000-word PDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Fatal Flaw: Ignoring Word Order\n",
    "The primary drawback of the parallel calculation is that the **Self-Attention module cannot capture the order or sequence of the words**. Since all words are processed at the same time, the module has no inherent mechanism to understand whether \"River\" came before \"Bank\".\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Example of Ambiguity:** For the Self-Attention module, the sentence \"Nitish killed Lion\" is **exactly the same** as \"Lion killed Nitish,\" even though they represent completely different meanings.\n",
    "*   **The Challenge:** Word order is critical in NLP applications. Therefore, the challenge is to find a way to **encode the order information** and pass it to the Self-Attention module so that the Transformer architecture can perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II. Initial, Flawed Solutions (First Principles Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture notes adopt a **First Principle Approach** to teach Positional Encoding by exploring simple solutions and identifying their flaws.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Solution 1: Simple Counting\n",
    "The simplest solution is to count the position of each word (1, 2, 3, 4, and so on) and **append this number as a new dimension** to the word's embedding vector (e.g., appending '1' to the embedding of the first word, '2' to the second, making the vector 513-dimensional if the original was 512-dimensional).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problems with Simple Counting:\n",
    "1.  **Unbounded Values:** This approach is **unbounded**; the position number grows linearly with the document length. If a document has 100,000 words, the final number is 100,000, which is huge.\n",
    "    *   **Neural Network Conflict:** Neural networks (which rely on **Backpropagation**) dislike large numbers because they lead to **unstable gradients**, causing issues like vanishing or exploding gradients. The preferred range for numbers in NNs is generally between -1 and 1.\n",
    "2.  **Normalization Fails:** Attempts to solve the unbounded problem by **normalizing** the positions (dividing by total word count) also fail. Normalization leads to **inconsistent values** for the same position across different sentence lengths (e.g., the second position might be normalized to 1 in one short sentence but 0.5 in a long sentence), which confuses the neural network.\n",
    "3.  **Discrete Numbers:** The positional numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) are **discrete**. Neural networks generally prefer **continuous** numbers and smooth transitions, as discrete values can cause issues with numerical stability and gradient flow.\n",
    "4.  **No Relative Position:** Simple counting only captures **Absolute Position** (the unique position of a word). It **cannot capture Relative Position**—the distance between two words. The model cannot easily calculate the distance (e.g., 3 - 1 = 2) because the input comes from a discrete function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## III. The Breakthrough: Using Trigonometric Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of the flaws in simple counting led to the realization that an ideal function must be **bounded, continuous, and periodic**. This pointed directly to **trigonometric functions**, specifically the sine function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Solution 2: Single Sine Function\n",
    "The second proposed solution involves using the sine function: $Y = \\sin(\\text{Position})$, where the word's position (e.g., 1, 2, 3) is the input to the sine function, and the output (Y, the encoded value) is appended to the embedding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of the Sine Function:\n",
    "*   **Bounded:** The output value ($Y$) always stays between **-1 and 1**, solving the unbounded problem.\n",
    "*   **Continuous:** The sine curve is a continuous function, addressing the discrete number problem.\n",
    "*   **Relative Position (Theoretical):** Theoretically, a periodic function like the sine curve **can capture relative position**, though the lecturer reserves the mathematical proof for later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Critical Flaw: Non-Unique Values (Periodicity)\n",
    "The major flaw of a single sine function is its **periodicity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Since the curve repeats its pattern, two words at different positions (e.g., Position 3 and Position 35) might generate the **exact same positional encoding value**.\n",
    "*   If two words have the same PE value but different positions, the model will be confused, thinking they are at the same position, which leads to major errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Solution 3: The Sin-Cos Pair (Vector Representation)\n",
    "The problem of repeating values is solved by switching from a single function (scalar output) to a **pair of trigonometric functions (vector output)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Mechanism:** For every word, two values are calculated: one from the **sine curve** and one from the **cosine curve**.\n",
    "*   **Vector Representation:** The Positional Encoding is now represented as a **vector** (e.g., $[0.84, 0.5]$) rather than a single scalar value.\n",
    "*   **Advantage:** The probability of two different words having the **exact same two numbers** (the same vector) is significantly lower, reducing the chance of value repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Solution 4: Multiple Sin-Cos Pairs (Varying Frequency)\n",
    "To handle very long documents where even a Sin-Cos pair might eventually repeat, the solution is to **increase the dimensionality** of the Positional Encoding vector by adding **more pairs of Sin-Cos functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Pair Extension:** Subsequent pairs are introduced by dividing the position by an increasing factor: $\\sin(\\text{Position}/2)$ and $\\cos(\\text{Position}/2)$, then $\\sin(\\text{Position}/3)$ and $\\cos(\\text{Position}/3)$, and so on.\n",
    "*   **Frequency Modulation:** As more pairs are added, the **frequency** of the curves is continually **reduced**. This ensures that even for very large documents, the final, high-dimensional PE vector is extremely unlikely to repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "## IV. The Final Implementation in the Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "The final solution adopted in the \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper is the advanced version of the multiple Sin-Cos pair approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. PE Vector Properties\n",
    "1.  **PE is a Vector:** The Positional Encoding for every word is a **vector** (a set of numbers).\n",
    "2.  **Dimension Matching:** The dimension of the PE vector must **exactly match** the dimension of the word's Embedding Vector ($D_{\\text{model}}$). If the embedding is 512-dimensional, the PE must also be 512-dimensional.\n",
    "3.  **Combination Method:** The PE vector is **added** to the Embedding Vector, not concatenated.\n",
    "    *   **Rationale for Addition:** Concatenation would double the dimension (e.g., 512 to 1024), which would double the **number of parameters** in the neural network and significantly increase the **training time**. Addition maintains the dimension, keeping the training fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Calculation Using the Official Formula\n",
    "The values inside the PE vector are calculated using the official formula from the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{PE}(\\text{pos}, i) = \\begin{cases} \\sin(\\text{pos} / 10000^{2i/D_{\\text{model}}}) & \\text{if } i \\text{ is even} \\\\ \\cos(\\text{pos} / 10000^{2i/D_{\\text{model}}}) & \\text{if } i \\text{ is odd} \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **$D_{\\text{model}}$:** Dimension of the embedding (e.g., 512).\n",
    "*   **pos (Position):** The position of the word (starts at 0 for the first word).\n",
    "*   **$i$ (Dimension Index):** Fluctuation from 0 up to $D_{\\text{model}} - 1$.\n",
    "*   **Paired Calculation:** For every two consecutive dimensions (an even $i$ and an odd $i$), a **Sin-Cos pair** is used.\n",
    "*   **Frequency Control:** The denominator term, $10000^{2i/D_{\\text{model}}}$, mathematically controls the **frequency** of the sine/cosine waves, ensuring the frequency decreases for every successive pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./images/pe1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Visualization:** Plotting these PE vectors shows a pattern highly similar to **Binary Encoding**, but implemented in the **continuous value domain** (using sine/cosine) instead of discrete values, which is exactly what neural networks prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## V. The Capture of Relative Position (The Mind-Blowing Property)\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecture notes save the discussion of **Relative Position** for last, as it is the most sophisticated property.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. The Hidden Property\n",
    "The way the Sin-Cos PE vectors are constructed imparts a \"mind-blowing\" property: for any given **delta (distance)** between two positions (e.g., $\\Delta = 10$), there exists a **single, specific Linear Transformation (Matrix)** that can convert the positional vector of the starting position ($V_{10}$) into the positional vector of the end position ($V_{20}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Example:** A specific matrix $M_{\\Delta=10}$ can transform $V_{10} \\to V_{20}$. Crucially, this *same* matrix $M_{\\Delta=10}$ can also transform $V_{30} \\to V_{40}$.\n",
    "*   **Generalization:** For every possible distance ($\\Delta=1, \\Delta=2, \\dots$), there is a corresponding Linear Transformation matrix available in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Implication\n",
    "This means that the system inherently knows the distance between any two positions, allowing it to capture **Relative Position**, a feature that was impossible to encode with simple discrete numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Mathematical Rationale\n",
    "The reason this linear relationship exists is precisely **because of the use of the Sin-Cos pair**. The pair forces the mathematical convergence required to capture relative distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This property is what transforms Positional Encoding from a simple counting mechanism into a powerful, learned representation of sequence order within the Transformer architecture.\n",
